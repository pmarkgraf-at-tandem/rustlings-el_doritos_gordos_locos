# Retrospectives

## 2026-02-06

### What went well today?
* Really helpful to go through the exercises a second time
* New concepts seemed straight-forward

### Thoughts
* No shortcuts - need to read and understand the language deeply
* Still can pick up on nuances even when experienced
* Need to do practical projects helps solidify the concepts


## 2025-12-05

### What do I want to share

* The Rust documentation looks pretty good
* On larger exercises, rotate each test case; not the whole exercise

## 2025-12-01

### What did I like or learn today?

* I learned more about ownership and the difference between passing by reference and value
* First time hitting the Rust syntax, and new concepts like ownership
* Next time dropping someone in the middle, I should do a prep meeting with them ahead of time
* Good to learn about how garbage collection works in Rust
* Unit Structs are interesting... will need more examples to really grasp what they are for
* Ownership guards are interesting

### What went well today?

* Stopping and asking questions
* Using the hints was very helpful
  * Almost too good... like AI
* We are getting better at navigating
  * being clear and specific about what to change and where
* Good to know about destructuring and tuples
* Seeing map was interesting, but need to digest that more

### What did you find interesting today?

* Got through a fair number of exercises today!
* Getting a better understanding of return and expression notation
* Saw the benefits of putting the terminal and code next to each other
* Felt better seeing the countdown of problems!
* Learned about the BIG UTF-8 characters and packed strings

### What thoughts do you have on today and using Rustlings?

* Compiler errors are very good... descriptive
* Learned about "shadowing variables" in Rust
  * Does C allow this? I'm pretty sure it does (but our coding standard does not)
* Variables are immutable by default
* Convention is that variables are snake_case (all lower-case, with underscore separators)
* Smooth when people joined during the session
