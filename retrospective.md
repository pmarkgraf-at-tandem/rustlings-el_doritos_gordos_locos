# Retrospectives

## 2025-11-17

### What did you find interesting today?

* Got through a fair number of exercises today!
* Getting a better understanding of return and expression notation
* Saw the benefits of putting the terminal and code next to each other
* Felt better seeing the countdown of problems!
* Learned about the BIG UTF-8 characters and packed strings

### What thoughts do you have on today and using Rustlings?

* Compiler errors are very good... descriptive
* Learned about "shadowing variables" in Rust
  * Does C allow this? I'm pretty sure it does (but our coding standard does not)
* Variables are immutable by default
* Convention is that variables are snake_case (all lower-case, with underscore separators)
* Smooth when people joined during the session
