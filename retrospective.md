# Retrospectives

## 2025-11-24

### What went well today?

* Stopping and asking questions
* Using the hints was very helpful
  * Almost too good... like AI
* We are getting better at navigating
  * being clear and specific about what to change and where
* Good to know about destructuring and tuples
* Seeing map was interesting, but need to digest that more

### What did you find interesting today?

* Got through a fair number of exercises today!
* Getting a better understanding of return and expression notation
* Saw the benefits of putting the terminal and code next to each other
* Felt better seeing the countdown of problems!
* Learned about the BIG UTF-8 characters and packed strings

### What thoughts do you have on today and using Rustlings?

* Compiler errors are very good... descriptive
* Learned about "shadowing variables" in Rust
  * Does C allow this? I'm pretty sure it does (but our coding standard does not)
* Variables are immutable by default
* Convention is that variables are snake_case (all lower-case, with underscore separators)
* Smooth when people joined during the session
