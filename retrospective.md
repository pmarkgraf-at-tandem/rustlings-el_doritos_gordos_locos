# Retrospectives

## 2025-11-12

### What thoughts do you have on today and using Rustlings?

* Compiler errors are very good... descriptive
* Learned about "shadowing variables" in Rust
  * Does C allow this? I'm pretty sure it does (but our coding standard does not)
* Variables are immutable by default
* Convention is that variables are snake_case (all lower-case, with underscore separators)
* Smooth when people joined during the session
